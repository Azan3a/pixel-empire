# Welcome to your Convex + Next.js + Convex Auth app

This is a [Convex](https://convex.dev/) project created with [`npm create convex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-convex).

After the initial setup (<2 minutes) you'll have a working full-stack app using:

- Convex as your backend (database, server logic)
- [React](https://react.dev/) as your frontend (web page interactivity)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for optimized web hosting and page routing
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for building great looking accessible UI
- [Convex Auth](https://labs.convex.dev/auth) for authentication

## Get started

If you just cloned this codebase and didn't use `bun create convex`, run:

```
bun install
bun run dev
```

If you're reading this README on GitHub and want to use this template, run:

```
bun create convex@latest -- -t nextjs-convexauth
```

After creating the project, install the Convex Auth dependencies:

```
bun install @convex-dev/auth @auth/core@0.37.0
```

Then, configure Convex Auth by running:

```
npx @convex-dev/auth
```

Follow the prompts to:

- Set the SITE_URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
- Configure private and public keys
- Update the tsconfig.json if needed

Finally, start the development server:

```
bun run dev
```
